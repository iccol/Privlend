									<p>DeFi loan syndication is the grouping of Individual participants structured, arranged, and administered by one or several community members known as lead.<br>
<br>
<Strong>DeFi Loan market overview/</strong>

The developing ecosystem for loan syndication consists of local Induviduals, businesses and professional investors, financing in most cases fully collateralized short term loans.<br>

<P>Traditionally three key actors operate within syndicated lending:</p>

Arranger<br>
Agent<br>
Trustee
<br><br>
										
<p><strong>Syndicate by Mortgage S.I. encompasses</strong></p>

Lead<br>
Syndicate
<br><br>
<p>Due to the high level of decentralization the DeFi loan placement process does not require burdensome layers, or credit checks. The Blockchain ensures a record of any lending activity and additionally has an order book market (OBM) and Automated Market Makers (AMMs) to rapidly exchange fungible collateral if a loan obligation is not satisfied.</p>
<br>

									<p><strong>Next level lending /</strong>

A lead for any deal can arrange next level placement whereby the arranger can guarantee the entire commitment, then syndicate the loan, into a private network.</p>

<br>
<strong>Top Tier Syndication /</strong>

The lead arranger's group commits to purchase equal to the entire amount of the fully-backed loan. No worries about the vicissitudes of the credit market. Every loan is collateralized with fungible base/counter cryptocurrency.</p>
<br>

									<p><strong>Our Philosophy/</strong>

A 100% loan commitment + 100% collateralized loan can = a satisfying loan condition, without illiquid asstes to dispose of and re-market.
<br><br>
<p>Can I include a traditional bank, fintech start up or large professional investor club be in my syndicate/</p>

Yes
<br><br>
<p>Can I include a foreign firm, fintech or large professional investors  in my syndicate/</p>

Yes

<br><br>
Q: Why does the issuer loan it's cryptocurrency</p>
A: Syndicate saas is provided by Mortgage S.I. an issuer. Lending our verified cryptocurrency allows it to help the ecosystem by reducing high fees and the need to secure more resources to post a loan.</p>
