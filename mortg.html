<strong>Syndicated loans (Defi)</strong>
"A syndicated loan is one where a group of financial individuals or institutions lend to a single borrower. 

Mortgage S.I. loan syndication occurs when two or more lenders come together to fund one loan for a  borrower. Syndicate handles loans that are too large for one individual or institution or falls outside the risk tolerance of a bank. The individuals or institutions in our loan syndicate share the risk and are only exposed to their portion of the loan.

<p><strong>How the Syndicate lends</strong><br>
1) Upon receiveing a loan application across the stellar P2P network or any P2P stellar network that is suitable for us, we ensure that the collateral is sufficient to cover losses if the borrower fails to repay the loan.<br>

<p>The Syndicate can create a lend application. In that case, the borrowers will submit their loan applications directly to Syndicate.</p><br>
 
2) We make an offer to the borrower 
3) After the borrower review and acceptance of the offer. We're notified if the borrower accepts the offer.
4) When the loan term ends which can be 24 hours, days, months or annually, the Syndicate claims repayment or the fungible collateral if the borrower fails to repay the loan.</p>

<p>Our risks?</p><br>
Loans can be 100% collateralized but there risks involved in loan syndication:

1) The value of borrower collateral should be sufficient to recover the losses if the borrower fails to repay the loan.<br>
2) <strong>The are no liquidations.</strong> If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the Syndicate receives the collateral asset. The Syndicate is responsible for selling/exchanging the collateral to recover losses (collateral is subject to market fluctuations.)<br>
